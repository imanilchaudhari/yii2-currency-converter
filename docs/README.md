This package provides the most famous currency rates providers' implementations. The package was originally built on Yahoo API, but there was a discontinuation of it. It is therefore highly recommended that you make use of only active providers, such as the ones listed below.

### Active Provider
- [Fotrex API](ApiForexApi.md)
- [Currency API](CurrencyApi.md)
- [CurrencyFreaks API](CurrencyFreaksApi.md)
- [Currency Layer API](CurrencylayerApi.md)
- [Exchange Rates API](ExchangeRatesApi.md)
